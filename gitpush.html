        First lets discuss what is git? <br>
        Git is a 
        <dfn>
            free and open source 
        </dfn> 

        distributed control system designed to handle <br> 
        everything from small to very large projects
        with speed and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Here are the steps to push your code to your own repository
    </h2>

    <pre>

        1. Type the following in the git bash terminal. <br>
            Output: 
                <samp>
                    $ #mkdir
                    $ git status
                    $ pwd
                </samp>

        2. Next you have to locate the file using the following <br>

           Output:
        <samp>
                     $ cd webDev
                     $ cd gitpush
        <samp>

        3. Now let us list <br>
            Output:
        <samp>
                    $ ls
                    $ cd Advance-Web-Programming 
                    $ ls -lrth
        <samp>
        
        5. Next, you need to know the git status and track the file in order to push the file <br>
            Output:
        <samp>
                    $ git status
                    $ git add gitpush.html
                    $ git commit -m
                    $ git commit -m "Finally"
                    $ git push -u
        <samp>

       6. Now, you can view your file in your github repository.
