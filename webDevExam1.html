        Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland.<br> 
        At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. <br>
        Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. <br>
