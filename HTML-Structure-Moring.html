        Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition 
        in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance.
        They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. 
        People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care
        about the feelings of others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence,
        they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest
        criticism.

        A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life,
        such as relationships, work, school or financial matters. People with narcissistic
        personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not
        given the special favors or admiration that they believe they deserve. They may 
        find their relationships troubled and unfulfilling, and other people may not enjoy
        being around them.

        Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy,
        also called psychotherapy.
